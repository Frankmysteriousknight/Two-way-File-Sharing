# Two-way-File-Sharing
In this server client program, the file can be shared in both the directions, either from server to client,
or client to server. One just needs to type FILE while chatting and specify the filename. If the file is present in the directory then 
it will transferred else, chatting will be continued. Chatting is also two way here.
The project is made on python.
The type of file shared is the image file.
